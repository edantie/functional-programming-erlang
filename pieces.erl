% Define a function pieces so that pieces(N) tells you the maximum number of pieces into which you can cut a piece of paper with N cuts.
% You can see an illustration of this problem at the top of this step.
% If youâ€™d like to take this problem further, think about the 3-dimensional case. Into how many pieces can you cut a wooden block with N saw cuts?
% Taking it even further: What is the general problem in n dimensions?
